    description: `
      Finally got around to rebuilding Ramble into how I imagined it. It's a full-stack journalling app with a simple, uncluttered interface in created with ShadCN UI. 
      Alongside being a generally good journalling app (for me), I fine-tuned Longformer to perform emotion classification on entries and used Recharts to plot emotional data.
      Inspired by a paper, the main idea was to be able to give users a more analytical approach to observing how their own emotions change.`,
