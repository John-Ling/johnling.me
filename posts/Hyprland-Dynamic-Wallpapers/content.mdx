Quick post because exam revision is mind numbing and makes me want to lobotomise myself.

On systems like macOS, wallpapers can be made "dynamic". That is, the wallpaper's appearance changes over time gradually fading light to dark mode alongside the day.

With some quick scripting, I replicated this effect to a degree on Hyprland. While you will not get the incredibly subtle changes found on macOS' implementation, you will get a wallpaper that can change appearance at certain times of the day. For me, I've kept it simple with a daytime wallpaper that runs until 9pm before switching to night, signifying it's time for me to stop working.

## Setup

Setup was incredibly simple if not a little crude. 

You'll, of course, need to select multiple wallpapers to switch between. For the longest time I've used the works of background artist [Arsenixc](https://www.deviantart.com/.arsenixc). Beyond static backgrounds, they also draw day, sunset and night versions of various scenes making them perfect. 

In my configuration, I placed my photos under `~/.config/hypr/wallpapers` 

### Script + Cron

I cobbled together this bash script to run hyprpaper based on the time, placing it in `~/.local/bin`. Make sure to make it executable with `chmod +x`.

<CodeBlock language="bash" filename="~/.local/bin/wallpaper.sh">
{`
#!/bin/bash

while ! pidof "hyprpaper" > /dev/null; do
    sleep 1
done

sleep 1
hour=$(date +%-H)

if [[ $hour -gt 6 ]]; then
    hyprctl hyprpaper reload ,"~/.config/hypr/wallpapers/island_day.jpg"
fi

if [[ $hour -gt 21 ]]; then
    hyprctl hyprpaper reload ,"~/.config/hypr/wallpapers/island_night.jpg"
fi
`}
</CodeBlock>

To achieve the automatic switching, I set up two cron jobs to run the script at 6am and 9pm thus changing the wallpaper at these times. While I could use Systemd timers, which seemed to be the approach used by others , I find cron a far simpler and thus better option for running a command at intervals. 

You'll likely need to install a cron client. On Arch Linux this is provided through the `cronie` package. 

<CodeBlock>
{`
sudo pacman -S cronie
`}
</CodeBlock>

Then enable the systemd service
<CodeBlock>
{`
sudo systemctl enable --now cronie.service
`}
</CodeBlock>

Once done, we can edit our current cron configuration via `EDITOR=vim crontab -e`. This assumes you have vim installed. If you prefer `nano` you can run `EDITOR=nano crontab -e` instead. 

Once there, insert these lines which will invoke our script daily at 6am and 9pm. 

<CodeBlock>
{`
0 6 * * * ~/.local/bin/wallpaper.sh
0 21 * * * ~/.local/bin/wallpaper.sh
`}
</CodeBlock>

### Hyprland + Hyprpaper Configuration

Some small tweaks need to be made to Hyprland and its wallpaper tool `hyprpaper`. Install it using your package manager.

Using pacman:

<CodeBlock>
{`
sudo pacman -S hyprpaper
`}
</CodeBlock>


Then amend your config file to run both `hyprpaper` and the wallpaper script. 

<CodeBlock>
{`
exec-once = hyprpaper
exec-once = ~/.local/bin/wallpaper.sh
`}
</CodeBlock>

## Result

Day:

Night (I set it manually):
