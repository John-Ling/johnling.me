title: "How to Connect to eduroam and UniWireless at Unimelb on Linux (IWD / Network Manager)"

When I first started at Unimelb, I had a bit of difficulty trying to connect to the WiFi since they use an enterprise network in fact I spent the first few days of uni working off my hotspot
because I was still trying to figure out how to connect to the WiFi.

Although they do provide some guidance for configuring the network on desktop environments like Gnome or KDE, for window managers like Hyprland, I3 or AwesomeWM, that configuration for those platforms
will have to be done manually.

Luckily if you're a first year you don't have to spend time trying to get your WiFi working during your Today's Science Tomorrow's World lecture (if you even go to them) since I've got a working configuration file 
for IWD and NetworkManager. 

## IWD

I use IWD for my laptop so I had to create a config file. 
Use `sudo su` to become root and create this file

<CodeBlock filename="/var/lib/iwd/eduroam.8021x">
{`
[IPv4]
DNS=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

[IPv6]
Enabled=true

[Security]
EAP-Method=PEAP
EAP-Identity=anonymous@student.unimelb.edu.au
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Method=MSCHAPV2
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Identity=YOUR UNIMELB EMAIL
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Password=YOUR UNIMELB PASSWORD

[Settings]
Autoconnect=true
`}
</CodeBlock>

Use this configuration for UniWireless

<CodeBlock filename="/var/lib/iwd/UniWireless.8021x">
{`
[IPv4]
DNS=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

[IPv6]
Enabled=true

[Security]
EAP-Method=PEAP
EAP-Identity=anonymous@student.unimelb.edu.au
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Method=MSCHAPV2
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Identity=YOUR UNIMELB USERNAME
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Password=YOUR UNIMELB PASSWORD
`}
</CodeBlock>


<CodeBlock>
{`
systemctl restart iwd
`}
</CodeBlock>

Now try connecting to the network 

<CodeBlock>
{`
iwctl station wlan0 connect eduroam
iwctl station wlan0 connect UniWireless
`}
</CodeBlock>

## Network Manager (nmcli)

Run the following commands as root or with sudo.

<CodeBlock>
{`
nmcli con add type wifi ifname wlan0 con-name eduroam ssid eduroam
nmcli con edit id eduroam
`}
</CodeBlock>

Once there set the following properties in nmcli.

<CodeBlock>
{`
set ipv4.method auto
set 802-1x.eap peap
set 802-1x.phase2-auth mschapv2
set 802-1x.identity YOUR UNIMELB EMAIL
set 802-1x.anonymous-identity anonymous@student.unimelb.edu.au
set 802-1x.password YOUR UNIMELB PASSWORD
set wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-eap
save
activate
`}
</CodeBlock>

To connect in the future
<CodeBlock>
{`
nmcli device wifi connect eduroam
`}
</CodeBlock>

For UniWireless

<CodeBlock>
{`
nmcli con add type wifi ifname wlan0 con-name UniWireless ssid UniWireless
nmcli con edit id UniWireless
`}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
{`
set ipv4.method auto
set 802-1x.eap peap
set 802-1x.phase2-auth mschapv2
set 802-1x.identity YOUR UNIMELB USERNAME
set 802-1x.anonymous-identity anonymous@student.unimelb.edu.au
set 802-1x.password YOUR UNIMELB PASSWORD
set wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-eap
save
activate
`}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
{`
nmcli device wifi connect UniWireless
`}
</CodeBlock>
