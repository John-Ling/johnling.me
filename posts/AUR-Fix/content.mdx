If you've ever used Arch Linux for the past few weeks, you may have encountered issues installing packages from the AUR.

Or you may have seen this when visiting https://aur.archlinux.org/

## Why Is This?

Currently, the AUR is experiencing a DDOS attack.

Yeah that's about it. Why someone would DDOS the AUR of all places is up for speculation. Perhaps a Manjaro fan haha.


## The Fix

As outlined by Christian Heusel, Arch Linux maintains a GitHub hosted mirror for the AUR which currently is not down. Until you can regain access to the AUR, this will be your source of access.

<CodeBlock>
{`
git clone --branch paru --single-branch https://github.com/archlinux/
aur.git paru
cd par
paru -si
`}
</CodeBlock>
_Substitute paru for whatever AUR package you want._

These commands will clone the package from GitHub, build then install it. 


If this approach is tedious I've written a script that does this for you. I call it urap.
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`
#!/bin/bash

# a bash script i wrote becuaes the aur kicked the bucket
# use when your aur helper doesn't work

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "no argument provided"
  echo "usage: ./urap package"
  exit 1
fi

echo -e "\\033[33;1mDownloading package\\033[0m"

if [ -d "$1" ]; then
    echo "Directory $1/ already exists"
    exit 1
fi


git clone --branch $1 --single-branch https://github.com/archlinux/aur.git $1 > /dev/null
if [ $? != 0 ]; then
    echo -e "\\033[31;1mFailed to download package\\033[0m"
    exit 1
fi
cd $1

echo -e "\\033[33;1mBuilding package\\033[0m"
makepkg -si

echo -e "\\033[32;1mInstalled package successfully!\\033[0m"
cd ../
rm -rf $1
`}
</CodeBlock>
I've put this script in my PATH and I'll be using it going forward when the AUR is down.

_As of writing the AUR is down but should be up soon._


Until the DDOS attacks stop, expect intermittent behaviour from the AUR and I'll be expecting to use `urap` way more times.
