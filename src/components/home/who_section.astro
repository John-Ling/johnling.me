    <p class="mb-5">
      Currently based in Australia, I&apos;m studying Computer Science at university.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      When not studying, I&apos;ve always enjoyed building things and picked up programming as a way of doing so.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      The first version of this website was built way back in 2022 originally as a 
      part of an online course. Since then, however, I&apos;ve kept it around as my own personal website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond programming, I enjoy the piano, building simple circuits and repairing electronics.
